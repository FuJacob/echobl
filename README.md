## What is EchoBl?
<div id="key-features" />

EchoBl was created in response to the difficulty of having meaningful discussions on controversial topics with those holding opposing views. For instance, on platforms like Reddit, subreddits often reinforce a groupthink mentality due to the upvote system.

**EchoBl changes that by giving users the power to create their own debate spaces, where they can engage in open discussions with people from all sides of the conversation.**
* **Debate Bubbles**  
  - Users can create and join "bubbles" based on various controversial topics to share and challenge opinions in real-time.
* **Topic Categories**  
  - Categories range from politics to lifestyle, ensuring there's a bubble for every passionate discussion.
* **Real-Time Discussion**  
  - Engage in live discussions and see arguments unfold as people present their views.
* **Voting System**  
  - Participants can vote on arguments to either agree, disagree, or support different viewpoints.
* **User Profiles**  
  - Create profiles to track your past debates, votes, and contributions to various topics.
